      The photos requested are specific to writing an accurate estimate so we ask you don't skip any however you have the option if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When adding photos of your vehicle you have 4 options.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>TAKE NEW PHOTO</strong> activates the phones internal camera. Snap a clear shot of what is requested and then either retake, save or cancel the photo. Each phone shows different icons or words for this process. </li>
      <li><strong>USE EXISTING PHOTOS</strong> open the phone internal photo library. Select the appropriate shot of the damage. </li>
      <li><strong>SKIP</strong> can be used if you cannot provide a requested photo. </li>
      <li><strong>CANCEL</strong> returns you to the initial screen to start the process again. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      &nbsp;You need to either submit or skip each requested photo.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="auto-style1"><strong>Review Photos</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This screen shows all the photos you selected or took. Scroll to the bottom of this list reviewing the photos and if necessary click <strong>REPLACE PHOTO</strong> to remove and add a new shot. After you're satisfied with the photos touch <strong>SUBMIT</strong> to begin sending the photos (this will use some of your data plan).

    <p>
      <strong><span class="auto-style1">What Happens Next?</span> </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      After the app successfully sends the photos to SCA Appraisal Company we will write the damage estimate, usually within a few hours, and send it to the insurance carrier covering the repairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insurance adjuster will contact you with any questions or to find out where you would like to take your vehicle for repairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="auto-style1"><strong>Thank You</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope this was a relatively effortless transaction. Please keep the app on your phone until your vehicle is repaired in case additional damage photos are needed. After repairs are complete feel free to remove the app.
    </p>
